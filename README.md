# glaceon-live
This was a frontend for a small streaming website I had put together for myself, based on a set
of configurations known as The Apparatus - a custom streaming setup made by Unascribed at sleeping.town. 

I don't use this anymore, as honestly I'm not really all that good with frontends, and there's also now
full-fledged apps for creating your own streaming site that're easier to manage. So, I'm leaving this here for
archival purposes.
